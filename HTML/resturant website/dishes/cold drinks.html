            <img src="../images/pakola.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="">Pakola is a uniquely Pakistani carbonated
            soft drink, famous for its bright green color and distinct creamy
            flavor, often compared to vanilla or bubblegum. It's sweet, fizzy, and nostalgic — a cultural icon that’s
            been a part of celebrations and everyday moments for generations. Best served chilled, Pakola adds a fun and
            flavorful twist to any meal or gathering.
