            <img src="../images/dal chawal.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt=""> Daal Chawal is a classic comfort food
            from South Asia, made with simple yet nourishing ingredients â€” lentil
            curry (daal) served over steamed basmati rice (chawal). The daal, typically cooked with turmeric, garlic,
            cumin, and other spices, is smooth, flavorful, and protein-rich. Paired with fluffy rice, it's a wholesome,
            everyday meal that's both satisfying and easy on the stomach. Often enjoyed with pickles, yogurt, or papad,
            daal chawal is the definition of soulful simplicity.
