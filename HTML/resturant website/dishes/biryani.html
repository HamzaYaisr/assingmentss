        <img src="../images/chicken biryani.jpg" width="100" height='100' alt=""> Chicken Biryani is a fragrant and
        flavorful South Asian rice dish made with marinated chicken, aromatic basmati
        rice, and a blend of bold spices like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. Layered and slow-cooked to perfection, the
        dish delivers tender chicken and richly spiced rice in every bite. Often served with raita (yogurt sauce) or
        salad, chicken biryani is a festive, crowd-pleasing meal thatâ€™s both hearty and deeply satisfying.

        <img src="../images/beef biryani.jpeg" width="100" height='100' alt=""> Beef Biryani is a rich, aromatic rice
        dish featuring tender, slow-cooked beef layered with fragrant basmati rice
        and a bold blend of spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and cumin. Cooked using the traditional dum
        (steaming) method, each grain of rice absorbs the deep, savory flavors of the meat and masala. Often garnished
        with fried onions, herbs, and served with raita or salad, beef biryani is a hearty, indulgent meal that
        celebrates bold South Asian flavors.
