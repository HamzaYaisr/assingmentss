        <dd> <img src="../images/chicken pulao.jpg" alt="" width="100" height='100'>Chicken Pulao is a mildly spiced,
            aromatic rice dish made by cooking tender chicken pieces with basmati
            rice, whole spices, and a savory broth. Unlike biryani, pulao is typically one-pot and lighter in flavor,
            making it a comforting and easy-to-digest meal. Fragrant with hints of cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaf,
            chicken pulao is perfect for everyday dining â€” simple, wholesome, and delicious.</dd>

            <img src="../images/beef pulao.jpeg" alt="" width="100" height='100'>Beef Pulao is a hearty and aromatic
            one-pot rice dish made by simmering tender beef with basmati rice, whole
            spices, and a flavorful stock. Milder than biryani but rich in taste, it features subtle notes of cloves,
            black pepper, bay leaf, and cardamom, allowing the natural flavors of the beef to shine through. Often
            garnished with caramelized onions and served with raita or salad, beef pulao is a comforting, satisfying
            meal for any occasion.
