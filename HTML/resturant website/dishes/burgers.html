            <img src="../images/beef burger.jpeg" width="100" height="100" alt=""> A beef burger is a timeless favorite
            made with a juicy, seasoned ground beef patty grilled or pan-seared to
            perfection. Served on a soft, toasted bun, it’s typically layered with fresh lettuce, tomato, onions,
            cheese, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayo. Whether classic or loaded with extras, the beef
            burger is a satisfying, bold-flavored meal that never goes out of style.

            <img src="../images/beef smash.avif" width="100" height="100" alt=""> A beef smash burger is a crave-worthy
            twist on the classic burger, made by pressing a ball of ground beef
            flat on a hot griddle to create a crispy, caramelized crust. Thin, juicy, and packed with flavor, the patty
            is often stacked double or triple and served with melted cheese, pickles, onions, and special sauce on a
            toasted bun. It’s all about bold flavor, crispy edges, and juicy bites — a true burger lover’s dream.

            <img src="../images/chicken burger.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt=""> A chicken burger is a lighter yet
            equally satisfying alternative to the classic beef burger, featuring a
            juicy chicken patty that can be grilled, fried, or breaded. Served on a soft bun, it's often topped with
            fresh lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheese, and sauces like mayo, spicy aioli, or honey mustard. Crispy or
            tender, the chicken burger offers a delicious balance of flavor and texture in every bite.
