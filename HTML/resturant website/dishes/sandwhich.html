        <img src="../images/" alt="" width="100" height='100'>A BBQ sandwich is a hearty, flavor-packed dish featuring
        tender, slow-cooked meat — often pulled beef, or
        chicken — smothered in rich, smoky barbecue sauce. Served on a soft bun, it’s typically topped with coleslaw or
        pickles for a perfect balance of savory, tangy, and sweet. Ideal for lunch, dinner, or casual gatherings, this
        classic comfort food delivers bold taste in every bite.

        inside, it’s a fun, handheld twist on traditional pizza, perfect for a quick meal or snack.</dd>
